# Wavetable

This is a library for generating and using wavetables. It is currently used in
the Yazz software synthesizer.

This is not yet in a very useful state, the code was just ripped out of the
synthesizer and is currently being reworked into a library. It needs a lot of
refactoring, testing and optimization. There is also no documentation yet.

Once it is finished, the library will offer support for importing wavetables
from wave files, bandlimiting the tables to avoid aliasing, storing tables in a
compressed format and getting samples from the tables.
